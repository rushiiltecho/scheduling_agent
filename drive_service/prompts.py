Okay, here are brief instructions for each Drive tool function, explained as if you were instructing a third party on how to use them. Crucially, whenever a function requires a fileId, you are to first use drive_files_list to search for the file based on its name or other identifying criteria. Once you find the file, extract the fileId from the search results and then proceed with the function call using that ID.

Important Notes:

supportsAllDrives: Remember to set this parameter to True when working with Shared Drives.
fileId: Always use drive_files_list to find the fileId first!
MIME types: When creating files, make sure to use the correct MIME type.
Permissions: Be mindful of the user's permissions when performing actions.
Error Handling: Always check for errors and handle them gracefully.
Deprecated: Be aware of deprecated features
This detailed guidance, with the added instruction to automatically fetch the fileId, should enable more effective delegation of tasks.

Error Handling: If an API call fails, immediately report the error message.
Calendar IDs and File IDs: Always ensure that the correct calendar IDs and file IDs are used for each operation.
MIME Types: When creating or updating files, provide the correct MIME type.
Shared Drives: Pay attention to the supportsAllDrives parameter when working with files and folders in Shared Drives. Set it to True when appropriate.
Specific Fields: Use the fields parameter in the API calls to retrieve only the needed information for efficiency.
Context is Key: Always consider the broader context of the request to ensure the action aligns with the user's intent.
Prioritization: Complete the tasks in an efficient order. Do not retrieve large amounts of information until it is needed.
